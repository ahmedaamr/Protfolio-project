		<h3> About </h3>
			<div class="about">
					<p> I am an energetic and enthusiastic person who enjoys a challenge and achieving personal goals. My present career aim is to work within IT because I enjoy working with computers, I enjoy the environment and I find the work interesting and satisfying. The opportunity to learn new skills and work with new technologies is particularly attractive to me.

		<h3> Courses </h3>
			<div class="first">
				<h4> OOP Course </h4>
				<p> The programming challenge was seen as how to write the logic, not how to define the data. Object-oriented programming takes the view that what we really care about are the objects we want to manipulate rather than the logic required to manipulate them. Examples of objects range from human beings (described by name, address, and so forth) to buildings and floors (whose properties can be described and managed) down to the little widgets on a computer desktop (such as buttons and scroll bars). </p>
			</div>

			<div class="second">
				<h4> Web Design Course </h4>
				<p> Although web design has a fairly recent history, it can be linked to other areas such as graphic design. However web design can also be seen from a technological standpoint. It has become a large part of peopleâ€™s everyday lives. It is hard to imagine the Internet without animated graphics, different styles of typography, background and music. </p>
